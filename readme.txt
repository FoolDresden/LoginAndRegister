Clone the project. 
Pre installed:
1. Node
2. Mongo

Run "mongod --dbpath ./" in a folder where you want it to store database data.
After setting up mongod, run the project through "node server.js"
Goto localhost:3000
Automatic redirect is yet to come. 
Endpoints:
localhost:3000/
localhost:3000/login
localhost:3000/register
There are no error messages for login yet. Will be added later.
